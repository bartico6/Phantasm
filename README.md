# Phantasm AntiCheat

Born out of the dire need to combat neverending waves of cheaters proactively, rather than reactively, Phantasm aims to stop exploitation of game flaws as well as cheating - including inventory/item cheats, crash exploits, lag machines, projectile alterring and other unwanted activities - in their tracks!

### Disclaimer

For the time being, Phantasm is nowhere near usable.
This repository will serve as a bug tracker for servers participating in the beta (once the plugin becomes stable and usable).
If and when the project succeeds and becomes usable, I will begin distributing the plugin to trusted parties for more open testing.
Don't message me asking for early builds or about methods I'm using.

## The project is currently on hiatus until [Frostspark](https://github.com/Frostspark/) projects become functional. TShock's functionality (or lack thereof) effectively blocks Phantasm development.

### It's worth noting that this project isn't my main focus and thus is developed as I find issues - I'm not rushing anything as I want this to work in all environments and under various network conditions.
