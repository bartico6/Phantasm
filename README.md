# Disclaimer

For the time being, Phantasm is nowhere near usable.
This repository will serve as a bug tracker for servers participating in the beta (once the plugin becomes stable and usable).
If and when the project succeeds and becomes usable, I will begin distributing the plugin to trusted parties for more open testing.

# Phantasm AntiCheat

Born out of the dire need to combat neverending waves of cheaters proactively, rather than reactively, Phantasm aims to stop exploitation of game flaws as well as cheating - including inventory/item cheats, crash exploits, lag machines, projectile alterring and other unwanted activities - in their tracks!

# Implementation status

## Tile cheats: 
* Crash exploits: Complete
* Unobtainable and nonexistent tiles: Complete

* Range hacks: In progress

## Movement cheats:

* Untouched. In plans.

## Item cheats: 

* Waiting on other modules, currently only very basic checks.
