# Phantasm AntiCheat

Phantasm is a Terraria anti-cheat plugin that aims to stop all forms of cheating (and other harmful activity such as crash exploits and lag machines) in their tracks.
Phantasm works entirely at network level, and as such is prone to breaking when game versions change.

### Disclaimer

This repository contains no code. Phantasm is currently a private plugin in development.
The goal of this repository is to serve as an issue tracker for servers that have access to the plugin, as well as a progress tracker for myself.
Do not message me for early builds. If you want to see it in action - play on one of the servers that runs the plugin. I'll include a list eventually, when the plugin is stable & in active use.
